        <p1>O my Luve is like a red, red rose<br>That&rsquo;s newly sprung in June;<br>O my Luve is like the melody<br>That&rsquo;s sweetly played in tune.</p>
        <p2>So fair art thou, my bonnie lass,<br>So deep in luve am I;<br>And I will luve thee still, my dear,<br>Till a&rsquo; the seas gang dry.</p>
        <p3>Till a&rsquo; the seas gang dry, my dear,<br>And the rocks melt wi&rsquo; the sun;<br>I will love thee still, my dear,<br>While the sands o&rsquo; life shall run.</p>
        <p4>And fare thee weel, my only luve!<br>And fare thee weel awhile!<br>And I will come again, my luve,<br>Though it were ten thousand mile.</p></div>

          <h1>CROSSING THE BAR</h1>
        <p5>Sunset and evening star,<br>And one clear call for me!<br>And may there be no moaning of the bar,<br>When I put out to sea,</p>
        <p6>But such a tide as moving seems asleep,<br>Too full for sound and foam,<br>When that which drew from out the boundless deep<br>Turns again home.</p>
        <p7>Twilight and evening bell,<br>And after that the dark!<br>And may there be no sadness of farewell,<br>When I embark;</p>
        <p8>For tho&rsquo; from out our bourne of Time and Place<br>The flood may bear me far,<br>I hope to see my Pilot face to face<br>When I have crost the bar.</p></div>

          <h1>THE ROAD NOT TAKEN</h1>
        <p9>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>And sorry I could not travel both<br>And be one traveler, long I stood<br>And looked down one as far as I could<br>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
        <p10>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>And having perhaps the better claim,<br>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>Though as for that the passing there<br>Had worn them really about the same,</p>
        <p11>And both that morning equally lay<br>In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
        <p12>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I&mdash;<br>I took the one less traveled by,<br>And that has made all the difference.</p></div>
